# FlightSimulatorApp
FlightSimulator #1 Our flight simulator recieves a csv file and an xml file, and we send it to the simulator. We built an application that allows us to show flight data on a dedicated Symbori and explore it. Our users are flight researchers or pilots who want to view data, sampled at a certain rate during any flight. Flight data is among other things, the position of the rudders, the speed, the height direction, etc. They send the data into a text file, which it can load. The app will play the information like a movie from the beginning of the recording until the end, it is a graphical representative of the the plane in relation to the Earth, the position of the rudders, and additional flight data in a number of different views, including the intended view to find data anomalies. We used MVVM archtecture in this project. We programmed in C# and used wpf model in our project. We used Visual Studios as our code editor.
